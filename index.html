    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <p>These Terms of Use (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of the Photo Scanner mobile application (the “<strong>App</strong>”), and any related services, features, and content provided by Photo Scanner (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”). By accessing, downloading, installing, or using the App or Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App or Service.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Introduction.</strong>
            <p>The Photo Scanner App provides document scanning, editing, format conversion (PDF, JPG, TXT via OCR), and document management features. The App is currently available for iOS only; These Terms form a binding contract between you and Photo Scanner regarding your use of the App and Service.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Authorized Users.</strong>
            <p>You may use the App only in compliance with applicable local, national, and international laws. If you are under the age required by local law to form a binding contract (commonly 18), please do not use the App. By using the App you represent that you are at least that age and have authority to accept these Terms.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Features; Subscriptions; Billing.</strong>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>Core Features.</strong> The App’s main features include: document (Document) scanning, ID card scanning, passport scanning, QR code scanning; editing tools (crop, rotate, contrast, add signatures, text/image/date/watermark/footer annotations, freehand markup); conversion to PDF, JPG, and TXT (OCR); and document management (rename, merge, create folders, move, search, sort, share).</li>

                <li><strong>Subscription Plans.</strong> Photo Scanner offers subscription-based access to certain premium features. Available paid plans are listed below (all prices in USD):
                    <table>
                        <tr><th>Plan</th><th>Price</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
                        <tr><td>Weekly</td><td>$3.99 / week</td><td>Includes a 7-day free trial for new subscribers (where available). Auto-renews.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Yearly</td><td>$24.99 / year</td><td>Auto-renews.</td></tr>
                    </table>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Free Trial.</strong> The weekly subscription may be offered with a 7-day free trial for first-time subscribers only. The free trial begins when you confirm the subscription through the App Store.
